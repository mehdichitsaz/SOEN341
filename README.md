1. Clone the repo
2. Open a CMD in the folder called <b>Backend</b> inside the folder you just clone the repo in

   NodeJS from here https://nodejs.org/en/download/
4. Now that you have NPM installed. Type <code>npm install</code> in the CMD you opened in step 2.
5. Now type <code>npm run watch</code> in the same CMD.
6. Open another CMD in the same folder (<b>Backend</b>) and type <code>npm run dev</code>
7. Now you are ready! Every time you modify a file the server will automatically restart itself to apply the changes
   Keep an eye on the CMDs because any error will appear there.
